01 - Initial Dataset Exploration
=================================

This script performs the initial exploration of the NGM (Next Generation McAfee) 
renewal dataset to understand its structure, size, and key characteristics.

Based on the SQL file, this appears to be a renewal investigation dataset 
focusing on subscription renewals, expirations, and customer segments.
